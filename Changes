Revision history for WWW-Purolator-TrackingInfo

1.0105  2014-01-18
        - Improved the return value to handle the 'Tracking system
          currently unvailable' error
        - Improved the tests to actually FAIL the tests, unless the
          error is a Network error or Trac. Sys. Cur. Unavailable error.

1.0104  2014-01-18
        - Doubled up the test, since I can obtain new tracking numbers
          by the handful; makes sense to test more.
